Hi, my name is Elias. Nice to meet you. I create stuff for a living. And well... I am also a Software Engineer, I previously worked at Huawei Ireland Research Center and more specifically at the Cloud Reliability R&D lab, building the foundations of Huawei Cloud. I was mainly focused on observability infrastructure.

I also worked on projects like Redshift (Amazon AWS) and financial systems (Stripe, Cielo, Banco Original, Banco Votorantim).

I decided to move to Tokyo and taste a bit of Japanese life.

I write [technical blog posts in English on my website](https://www.elias.sh/).

I create content in (Brazilian) Portuguese:
