# You should check my [CODEBERG](https://codeberg.org/era) profile AND NOT my GITHUB, I will not be creating new projects here

The projects listed here are only mirrors from my codeberg profile, in the future I won`t be creating those mirrors any more.

Keeping the account so I can contribute with software hosted here.

One example of my projects in Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/era/databook/
